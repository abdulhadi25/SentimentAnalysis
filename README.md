The COVID-19 pandemic was an extraordinary occurrence in modern human history, and the rapid spread of vaccines against COVID-19 virus was also an exceptional event. During severe stages of pandemic in 2020 and 2021 a number of vaccines against COVID-19 were introduced and were used worldwide in a very short time. For governments it was crucial to gain public trust in these vaccines to ensure collective immunity through vaccination.
Our research interest is focused on the question how populations react to such events? Have the authorities succeeded in gaining public trust?
In order to investigate it we gauged public sentiment regarding vaccines by analyzing social media. Generally, in the 21st century, social media provides the best insights; data collection and its analysis have long replaced traditional survey methods. Thus, collecting data on social media was the preferred choice for this project.
